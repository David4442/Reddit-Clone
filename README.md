# Fullstack Project Overview

## Description
This project represents the culmination of a fullstack development course. It encompasses the creation of both backend and frontend components of a web application from scratch, followed by deployment. Leveraging a versatile stack comprising React, TypeScript, GraphQL, URQL, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MikroORM, Redis, Next.js, TypeGraphQL, and Chakra, a robust and dynamic application was crafted.

## Backend Development
### Setup and Configuration
- Node.js with TypeScript was configured to lay the foundation for backend development.
- MikroORM was implemented for efficient database management.
- Apollo Server Express facilitated the creation of a GraphQL API.

### Key Features
- CRUD operations were seamlessly integrated using MikroORM and TypeGraphQL.
- Authentication mechanisms, session management, and error handling were implemented.
- Data relationships, pagination, and advanced query handling were explored.

## Frontend Development
### User Interface
- Next.js with Chakra was utilized to build engaging and responsive user interfaces.
- URQL streamlined GraphQL data fetching, ensuring optimal performance.

### Features
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) was employed for enhanced performance and SEO.
- User authentication, dynamic routing, and data pagination were seamlessly integrated.

## Deployment
### Containerization and Configuration
- Docker was utilized for containerization, simplifying deployment across various environments.
- Environment variables and database migrations were managed for seamless deployment.

### Deployment Process
- Deployment to platforms like Docker Hub was streamlined for efficient distribution.
- DNS configuration and frontend deployment ensured readiness for production use.

## Conclusion
This project provided an in-depth understanding of modern fullstack development practices. By mastering a comprehensive tech stack and tackling various challenges in backend development, frontend design, and deployment, I am now equipped to create scalable and efficient web applications.
